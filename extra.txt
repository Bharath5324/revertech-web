                As a data science enthusiast an internship about data mining organized by Revertech grabbed my attention. I was able to understand what exactly is data mining and how to do it through the well put class structure. Since it contained the basics of my favorite programming language Python the assignments given was fun to do and I always had help from our mentor. The classes were through Gmeet and we was able to discuss with our mentor ensuring complete grasping. The breaks caused by the weather was very well handled and we were able to complete the course very efficiently. When I finished my final project I was amused by how the scrapy system works and loved to understand what's under the hood of scrapy. Finally I am sure of myself that I am at a level to experimenting with different scrapy projects up to the intermediate level due to this internship provided by Revertech.<br><br><b>- Surav K S</b>
